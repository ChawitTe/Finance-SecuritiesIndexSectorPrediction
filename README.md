### Model Statistics:
- **R-squared**: 0.897
- **Adjusted R-squared**: 0.947
- **Standard Error of Estimate (SEE)**: 290.899
- **F-statistic**: 84.802
- **Significance (p-value)**: 0.000

Based on the test results using the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis method, with 6 independent variables, it was found that 5 of the independent variables significantly affect the stock price index of the financial and securities sector at a 0.05 significance level. These variables are:
- **Exchange rate (Baht/USD)**
- **Dow Jones Index**
- **10-year U.S. government bond yield**
- **2-year U.S. government bond yield**
- **General Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The multiple correlation coefficient (R) is 0.947, explaining 89.7% of the relationship. The regression equation can be expressed as follows:
Y^ = -8688.364 - 161.004X_1 + 0.125X_2 + 592.079X_3 - 578.824X_4 - 0.357X_5 + 142.357X_6
